What is pytest? 

1) Pytest is a testing framework for Python that has a auto-discovery feature based on file names 
 - and if they have "test" at the start or end 

Why Use it? 

1) Simplified Syntax i.e. assert statments 
2) Rich assertion introspection i.e. clear reports when things go wrong 
3) Powerful fixture system (operations can be built and taken down quickly)


What is Assert? 

1) If a test is run and there is no error the tests will continue but if the "assertion" isn't true then 
 - the program will stop and report 
2) Think of it as saying hey does when the function is called with a given set of variables 
 - does it return the value I expect it due i.e assert return ==


Pytest Markings (Markers)

1) Markers let you tag tests for selection, skipping, or expected failures.

Common built-in markers:

1) @pytest.mark.skip(reason="...") 
 - Always skip this test with a reason.

2) @pytest.mark.skipif(condition, reason="...")
 - Skip only when the condition is true (ex: sys.platform == "win32").

3) @pytest.mark.xfail(reason="...", strict=False)
 - Expected to fail; if it passes it is marked xpass (set strict=True to fail).

4) @pytest.mark.parametrize("arg1, arg2, expected", [...])
 - Run the same test function with multiple input sets.

5) @pytest.mark.usefixtures("fixture_name")
 - Apply fixtures to a test without listing them as parameters.

6) @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:...") 
 - Control warnings for a test or module.

Custom markers:

1) @pytest.mark.slow
 - You can define your own markers like slow, integration, or smoke.
 - Run selected tests with: pytest -m slow
 - Skip selected tests with: pytest -m "not slow"

Note: If you use custom markers, add them in pytest.ini under [pytest] with "markers ="
