# jhu_software_concepts
This is a repository for Modern Concepts of Python (Spring 2026)

Module 1 Notes ---------------

Following SSH authenication: 

I first accessed my "Github-Setup" directory on my local machine 
Following this I used "git clone + SSH" to clone my repo and used "touch Module_1_Solution" to add the file to my computer 
I then used "git add <filename>" to tell Git that I want to stage or include this file in the next commit 
I then wanted to bundle up these changes by using "git commit -m "Added Module 1 Solution""
Following this I take my prepared package and I use "git push" to add it to the main repo (i.e. from my computer to git)
