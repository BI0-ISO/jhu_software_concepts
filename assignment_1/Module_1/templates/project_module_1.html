<h1>Module 1 Project</h1>

<h2>Flask Portfolio Website</h2>

<p>
    In this assignment, I learned the fundamentals of website development by building my own personal developer 
    website. I designed a site that highlights who I am, what I’m passionate about, and the 
    projects I’ve worked on. Through this process, I explored the exciting world of web design and 
    development, gaining confidence in translating ideas into an interactive online experience. 
    I experimented with different layouts, styles, and design choices, discovering how even small tweaks 
    can significantly impact the look and feel of a website. This project allowed me to combine creativity with 
    technical skills in a way that feels both rewarding and empowering.
